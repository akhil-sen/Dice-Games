This code uses the random module to generate random numbers to simulate rolling dice. 
The roll_dice function returns a list of num_players random numbers between 1 and 6. 
The play_game function implements the game logic, allowing multiple players to take 
turns rolling the dice and keeping track of their scores. The game continues until all 
players decide to stop rolling the dice, and then a winner is determined based on the final scores.
