This code uses the random module to generate random numbers to simulate rolling dice. 
The roll_dice function returns a random number between 1 and 6. 
The play_game function implements the game logic, allowing two players to take turns 
rolling the dice and keeping track of their scores. The game continues until both players 
decide to stop rolling the dice, and then a winner is determined based on the final scores.
